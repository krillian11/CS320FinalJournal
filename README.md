After working on this project I have learned a lot of new techniques that I can use to improve future projects. Firstly, I can ensure that my software is functional and secure by using JUnit or whatever testing that is used for the particular language in order to make sure that my functions and objects are being created safely and correctly. Incorporating user needs is the basis of software development and each project that is created must have an MVP(minimum viable product) before development starts so that there is a basic ground/framework to work with. Typically this would involve writing down what the client is looking for and what the best solutions are for that particular problem. When trying to design software I try to first find the problem I want to solve. Then I make a simple solution, after developing a simple solution I then try to look for more advanced algorithms that will improve the speed and quality of the software that I'm developing.
